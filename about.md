# About

I am currently studying Mathematics at Merton College, University of Oxford. I achieved a first class Bachelor's degree, with an average of 81%, ranking 6th out 149 in my cohort. For exam performance, I have been awarded a Merton College Exhibition (2021), upgraded to a Postmastership (2022), then renewed as a Postmastership (2023). I also achieved four A*s at A-level in Maths, Further Maths, Computer Science and French.

I am proficient in C# and Python and have a wealth of experience in personal projects, ranging from games made in Unity to a pixel art painting program to automated code-breaking tools. The latter won me the University of Southampton's 2018 National Cipher Challenge among 7300+ entrants.

As well as programming, I enjoy singing in my university a cappella group, in which I hold the post of secretary. I am currently also serving as producer and audio editor for our upcoming music video. I have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@Williams_A_Cappella) for my own one-man a cappella covers that I arrange, record, edit and mix myself. Furthermore, I am self-taught in guitar and ukulele.
